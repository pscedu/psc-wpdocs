Track 4 (WFA): WFA, WSE Field-equation API¶
Field equations, includes ML inference.
Good Match Criteria: You would be a good match for this track if your research can integrate and make use of the WFA library.
WFA: API recently used for advancing CFP simulations at unprecedented resolution and speed (more info).
* Pioneering work - Beta testing of the WFA library.
* Only a few groups would be welcomed.
* Close collaboration with Dr. Dirk Van Essendelft's team, PSC, and Cerebras.
* Field equations, includes ML inference
Project Guidelines¶
Problem Requirements¶
* Must lay out on a Hex grid (3d or many 2d parallel)
* Should involve Spatial Locality
* Should be Data Intense
* Single Precision, <40GB
Problem Examples¶
* Computational Fluid Dynamics (FVM, FDM, FEM, LBM)
* Structural Mechanics
* Geomechanics
* Weather/Climate
* Materials – Ising Model, Density Functional Theory
* CNN/RNN inference
Project Requirements¶
* Build a Python class that imports the WFA and contains a “Library” to solve your scientific problem
* Post on a public GitHub
What to expect¶
* Development at the high-level Python interface that is similar to Numpy
* A container (provided by Cerebras) to compile and generate binaries and run on the WSE
* An unpolished product (Beta level) that will require some hand holding from our team on slack
* Be prepared for bugs and unpolished documentation
* Exceptional speed if successful, strong scaling that can’t be matched elsewhere
