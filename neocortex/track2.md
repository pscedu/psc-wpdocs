## Track 2 (ML): Models similar to the Cerebras modelzoo models
Track 2 is for ML models that are a **combination of the building blocks** used by modelzoo models and/or the layers supported by Cerebras as listed in their documentation.

**Good Match Criteria:** You would be a good match for this track if your research already uses, or could potentially use, the specific TensorFlow or PyTorch layers listed below for implementing the models.
### Supported Core Compute Kernels
#### Cerebras TensorFlow Layer API
Please check the [list of supported Tensorflow layers here](https://docs.cerebras.net/en/1.6.0/tensorflow-docs/api-rst/tf.html).
#### Cerebras PyTorch Layer API
* PyTorch Layer API: custom wrapper of several commonly used PyTorch APIs

Supported PyTorch Operations
   * Please check the [list of supported PyTorch layers and operations here](https://docs.cerebras.net/en/1.6.0/pytorch-docs/pytorch-ops.html).
