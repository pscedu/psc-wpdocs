### $PROJECT
Your $PROJECT directory is at /ocean/projects/*groupname*/*username*, where *groupname* is the Unix group id associated with your allocation, and *username* is your PSC username. 

This storage space is for storing large amounts of data and bigger files (>25GB) that are not required by the other team members. This space is the main userspace (private to each user) that charges against the group quota instead of the limited personal quota.

If you have access to multiple projects on PSC systems, please make sure to execute the `newgrp` command before using the $PROJECT variable, as described in the [Accounts section](https://www.psc.edu/resources/neocortex/docs/accounts).
