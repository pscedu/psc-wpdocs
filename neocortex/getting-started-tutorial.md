# Getting Started Tutorial
The Neocortex team compiled the "Hands-on FC-MNIST" example tutorial for you to get started using the Neocortex system. Please read the instructions below 
to download it and run it in the system. Make sure that you have an account on Neocortex first.
## Neocortex Open OnDemand
Go to [OnDemand](ondemand.neocortex.psc.edu), then navigate to Jupyter Notebook and start a job.
## Getting the Jupyter Notebook file
Download the Jupyter Notebook file from GitHub and install it in Neocortex.
1. Find the getting_started.ipynb file in GitHub: [getting_started.ipynb](https://github.com/pscedu/neocortex-public/blob/main/tutorial/getting_started.ipynb)
2. Click the **Raw** button to see the actual file contents.
3. Make sure you are logged in to Neocortex using the OnDemand link above. 
4. Use the `wget` command to download the Jupyter Notebook. Make sure to run this wget command inside the Neocortex system as that is where we need the file to be. For example:
   
   ``wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pscedu/neocortex-public/main/tutorial/getting_started.ipynb``
