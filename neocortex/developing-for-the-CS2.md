There are two different ways in which you can  make use of the CS-2:  
1. Using the main available frameworks, such as TensorFlow and Pytorch, while leveraging the Cerebras container and libraries. Please see [TensorFlow or Pytorch](https://www.psc.edu/resources/neocortex/docs/developing-for-cs/#tensorflow-or-pytorch).
2. Running an HPC workflow.  **this link is broken in the current documentation**
