## Accounts
Researchers will interact with the Neocortex (preferred) and perhaps the Bridges-2 systems. On Bridges-2, you can find the resources to precompile your code and estimate requirements that would facilitate the Neocortex execution (see section Reference Compilation for the CS-2 Commands). Bridges-2 resources can also be leveraged for data preprocessing and other parts of the processing workflow.
### Account creation
All Neocortex users need a PSC account. 
* If you already have a PSC username (from Bridges-2 or other PSC systems), share your username information via email to <a href="mailto:neocortex@psc.edu">neocortex@psc.edu</a>.
* If you do not already have a PSC username, please create one using the [Request a PSC Account](https://allocations.psc.edu/users/new) form.

When you have your PSC username and account, please make sure that you can reach Neocortex with your PSC credentials by trying to connect with this command:

<code>ssh <i>psc_username</i>@neocortex.psc.edu</code>

If you need to reset your PSC password, please visit the [PSC Password Change Utility](https://apr.psc.edu) webpage.
