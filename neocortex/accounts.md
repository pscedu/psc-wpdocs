# Accounts
Researchers will interact with the Neocortex (preferred) and perhaps the Bridges-2 systems. On Bridges-2, you can find the resources to precompile your code and estimate requirements that would facilitate the Neocortex execution (see the [Reference compilation example section](https://www.psc.edu/resources/neocortex/docs/reference-compilation-commands). Bridges-2 resources can also be leveraged for data preprocessing and other parts of the processing workflow.
## Account creation
All Neocortex users need a PSC account. 
 
* If you already have a PSC username (from Bridges-2 or other PSC systems), share your username information via email to <a href="mailto:neocortex@psc.edu">neocortex@psc.edu</a>.
* If you do not already have a PSC username, please create one using the [Request a PSC Account](https://allocations.psc.edu/users/new) form.

When you have your PSC username and account, please make sure that you can reach Neocortex with your PSC credentials by trying to connect with this command:
<pre>
ssh <i>psc_username</i>@neocortex.psc.edu
</pre>

If you need to reset your PSC password, please visit the [PSC Password Change Utility](https://apr.psc.edu) webpage.

## Adding new team members to an exisiting project

The steps to have new team members added to your Neocortex project are:

<ol>
<li><strong>Initiating the Request:</strong> The Principal Investigator (PI) of the project is responsible for initiating the request for new user accounts. The PI should email neocortex@psc.edu to make the request.
<br /><br />
<strong>Email Content:</strong> In the email, please provide the following information:

  <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
<li>Project Title: The title of the project for which the accounts are being requested.</li>

<li>Rationale: Explain why the accounts are being created at this point in the project, rather than at the beginning. This could include any specific tasks, collaborations, or requirements that have arisen.</li>

<li>Account Duration: Specify the duration for which the accounts should be active. This could be the project's anticipated lifetime or a specific number of months, depending on the project's needs.</li>
</ol>
<br />
<li><strong>Approval and Processing:</strong> Once the email is received, the request will be reviewed by the appropriate personnel. If the request is approved, the new Neocortex accounts will be created accordingly.</li></ol>

### Example:
```
Project Details:
- Project Title: [Project Name]
- Rationale: [Explain why accounts are needed at this stage]
- Account Duration: [Specify duration, e.g., project lifetime or X months]
```


## Off-boarding Team Members
When a researcher is no longer part of a project and their access needs to be revoked, please request that they be off-boarded as soon as possible.

**Initiating the Request:** The Principal Investigator (PI) of the project is responsible for promptly initiating the request for off-boarding individuals who are no longer actively contributing to their project. The PI should email neocortex@psc.edu to make the request.  Be sure to include any relevant information about the individual to off-board.

**Confirmation of Off-boarding:** The Neocortex team will review the request and proceed with the off-boarding process. The PI will receive confirmation once the researcher's access has been successfully deactivated.
