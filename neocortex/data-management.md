This section talks about the various storage spaces on Neocortex and how to use them.
  
## Common storage spaces
### $HOME 
  
Your $HOME directory is <code>/jet/home/<i>username</i></code>, where *username* is your PSC username. This is your personal storage space and has a cap of 25 GB. This should be used for personal files only, such as system configurations or maybe private files like experimental Conda environments.

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Danger</strong> 
<p>Exceeding your $HOME quota (storing >25GB under $HOME) will lock you out of the system, as you might not be able to login anymore.
