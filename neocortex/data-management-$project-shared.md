##### $PROJECT/../shared
This is a space inside the project that is writable by everyone in your specific group. This location is created by default, and it is the same type of space that was available on Phase 0 with the P## folders (also referred to as team_folder).

This directory can also be referred to as <code>/ocean/projects/<em>groupname</em>/shared</code>, where *groupname* is the Unix group id associated with your allocation.

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Note</strong>
    <p>The $HOME and $PROJECTS spaces are persistent, but the /local{1,2,3,4} spaces (/local1/, /local2/, /local3/, /local4/) are more ephemeral.</p>
