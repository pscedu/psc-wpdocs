## Getting Help
### How to request technical support
You have multiple options. You can:
* Check if your problem has been documented already. There is a [list of known technical issues](https://portal.neocortex.psc.edu/docs/current-known-issues.html) available.
* Ask using Slack. If you haven't, please join the [Neocortex Slack Organization](https://join.slack.com/t/neocortex-system/shared_invite/zt-19e7499up-bZeT870l71Od7XqwxixFmw). After you get into the Neocortex Slack, use any of the channels available to you:
   * Your project channel: in format #x00-lastname, is a private project channel for you and your team members, as well as the Neocortex and Cerebras team members, so all the project team members can brainstorm as needed and also request help from the Neocortex and/or Cerebras teams. In this example, "x" is one of the CFP cohorts (a, b, c, d), "00" is the project id, and "lastname" is the last name of your project PI.
   * #ai-projects: Public channel to discuss AI/ML-related subjects. All the AI/ML project team members can write in this channel, and all the AI/ML researchers will get the messages. You will get invited here if your project is on the AI/ML track.
   * #sdk-projects: Public channel to discuss SDK/HPC-related subjects. All the SDK/HPC project team members can write in this channel, and all the SDK/HPC researchers will get the messages. You will get invited here if your project is on the SDK or WFA tracks.
* Email us at neocortex@psc.edu. Describe the problem and include as much of the the following information as you can so we can reproduce the issue:
   * When is the issue happening?
   * Location of the code
   * Location of the input data
   * Script used for running the job
   * Sample output showing the problem
   * What is the expected output?
   * What is happening instead?
* Bring your questions to an "office hour" session. You will be meeting with both Neocortex and Cerebras team members.
  * Half an hour (30 mins) pre-scheduled sessions per group/project. You may request as many of these 30 minute sessions as you need.
  * To request a session per project, follow the appropriate link based on your project type:
     * [ML/AI Office hours](https://calendly.com/neocortex-system/neocortex-office-hours)
     * [SDK Office hours](https://calendly.com/neocortex-system/neocortex-office-hours)
   
  When scheduling the session, if you need help with a specific issue, please describe the problem and include the information listed in the preceding section to reproduce the issue.
