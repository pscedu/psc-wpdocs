Track 3 (SDK): General purpose SDK¶
The SDK is general purpose and can be used for a variety of things.
Good Match Criteria: You would be a good match for this track if you are willing to write low-level code, similar to writing CUDA, for implementing your research.
Pioneering algorithm coding from scratch.¶
* Analogous to CUDA for Nvidia GPUs.
* ML kernels cannot be integrated with Pytorch and/or TensorFlow.
* Requires significant commitment.
Sample topics of interest for HPC applications¶
* Structured grid based PDE and ODE solvers
* Dense linear algebra
* Sparse linear algebra
* Particle methods with regular communication
* Monte Carlo type problems that can fill the wafer
* Towards development of HPL, HPCG type benchmarks • Custom ML kernels
