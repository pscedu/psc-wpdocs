System Specifications¶
Neocortex features two Cerebras CS-2 systems and an HPE Superdome Flex HPC server robustly provisioned to drive the CS-2 systems simultaneously at maximum speed and support the complementary requirements of AI and HPDA workflows. Neocortex is federated with Bridges-2 to yield great benefits including:
* Access to the Bridges-2 filesystem for management of persistent data
* General-purpose computing for complementary data wrangling and preprocessing
* High-bandwidth connectivity to other XSEDE sites, campus, labs, and clouds
* The configuration of each specialized system is described below:
* Each CS-2 features a Cerebras WSE2 (Wafer Scale Engine2), the largest chip ever built.
