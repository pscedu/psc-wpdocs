### Structure of the code
Examples can be found in theÂ <a href="https://github.com/Cerebras/cerebras_reference_implementations" target="_blank">Cerebras reference implementation repository</a>, which contains examples of standard deep learning models that can be trained on Cerebras hardware and demonstrate the best practices for coding.
* `model.py`: contains the model function definition.
* `data.py`: where the input data dataloaders are defined.
* `utils.py`: contains the helper scripts.
* `configs/params.yaml`: YAML file containing the model configuration and the training hyperparameter settings.
* `run.py`: contains the training/compilation/evaluation script.
