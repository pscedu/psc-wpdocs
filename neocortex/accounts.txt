Accounts¶
Researchers are to interact with the Neocortex (preferred) and/or the Bridges-2 systems. In the latter, they would find the resources to precompile their code and estimate requirements that would facilitate the Neocortex execution (see section Reference Compilation for the CS-2 Commands). Bridges-2 resources can also be leveraged for data preprocessing and other parts of the processing workflow. Next, users can find information needed to manage their accounts.
Account creation
* All our users need a PSC account. The account creation is a two-step process:
* If you are active on Bridges-2 or other PSC systems, share your username information via email (neocortex@psc.edu); if not, please create an account using the "Request a PSC Account" form
* Once the account is created, please make sure that you can reach Neocortex with your PSC credentials.
* ssh PSC_USERNAME@neocortex.psc.edu
* If you need to reset your password, please visit the PSC Password Change Utility webpage.
Note
Please complete the "Getting ready to use the Neocortex system" training and submit the "Key Compilation Metrics Needed" form to get access to the total Neocortex allocation SU (Superdome Flex and CS-2s systems).
