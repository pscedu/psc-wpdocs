# Model Zoo

The Cerebras team has prepared a [Model Zoo](https://github.com/Cerebras/modelzoo) that has some models for you to get started. The repository is under continuous development. You can find the detailed instructions there for using the code.

The models available are listed in the Model Zoo ["Models in this repository" section](https://github.com/Cerebras/modelzoo#models-in-this-repository).

If you have any issues running any piece of code on the repository, please create a Github issue with appropriate steps to reproduce the bug along with the software stack you are using and logs generated.
