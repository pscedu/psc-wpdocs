Emily Nic is a Project Manager at PSC. She has an extensive background in Construction Project Management and a bachelorâ€™s degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Portland. Her background outside of work as a Certified Personal Trainer influences her working style as a coach and a collaborator. Asking questions, especially the right type of questions, is what she believes is one of the best ways to not only problem-solve, but to ensure the problems we approach are problems worth spending time on.
