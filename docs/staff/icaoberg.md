Iván Cao-Berg is a research software specialist in the Biomedical Applications Group at the [Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC)](https://www.psc.edu/), where he contributes to pioneering scientific projects like the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org/), the [Brain Image Library (BIL)](https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/), and [SenNet](https://sennetconsortium.org/), focusing on advancing computational methods in biomedical research.

Originally from Argentina and raised in Puerto Rico, Iván pursued graduate studies at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/) with funding from the National Institutes of Health. Before joining PSC, he worked in the Murphy Lab within CMU’s [Computational Biology Department](https://www.cbd.cmu.edu/) and collaborated with departments such as Biomedical Engineering and Biological Sciences.

Beyond his PSC role, Iván serves as a DEI undergraduate program manager for the Mellon College of Science and a high-performance computing consultant for the [Ray and Stephanie Lane Center for Computational Biology](https://www.cbd.cmu.edu/) in CMU’s [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/). He is also involved in establishing chapters for undergraduate and graduate students, acting as a bridge between students and administration to support underrepresented groups in the sciences.

Iván was the latest host of "Barrio Latino," Pittsburgh’s first Spanish-only radio show, which aired for over 25 years. Though he stepped down last year, his commitment to the Hispanic community remains strong through his leadership in the Pittsburgh Spanish Meetup Group and his role in organizing Hispanic Heritage Month events with institutions like CMU and the University of Pittsburgh.

An open-source enthusiast, Iván is passionate about reusing older technology, optimizing computational workflows in biology, and finding innovative solutions to existing problems. In his free time, he loves cooking and attempting to play the ukulele. His community contributions, notably his relief efforts following Hurricane María, have been recognized in CMU publications, underscoring his dedication to advocacy, innovation, and cultural engagement.
