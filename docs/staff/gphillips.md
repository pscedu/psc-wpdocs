Gesina is a Senior Systems Software Engineer working primarily on the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program](https://hubmapconsortium.org/) (HuBMAP).

Before coming to PSC in November 2022, Gesina was the Digital Scholarship Librarian at the University of Pittsburgh (2019-2022) and Duquesne University (2015-2018). She holds a Master of Library and Information Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh (2015). As a result of her past career experience, Gesina particularly enjoys solving data-related problems, determining project goals and requirements, and working with a team of technically-minded people. 

Before she developed any technical skills to speak of, Gesina obtained a BA (Seton Hall University, 2011) and MA (Carnegie Mellon University, 2012) in English. As a result of her past educational experience, she has lots of opinions about literature.

Outside of work, Gesina is a DJ at Carnegie Mellon's radio station, [WRCT](http://www.wrct.org/) (88.3 FM on your radio dial). She also enjoys reading (especially science fiction), baking, games, growing plants, dabbling in fabric arts, and volunteering with local social justice-related organizations.
