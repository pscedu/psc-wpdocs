As a Professor at the PSC and Carnegie Mellon University, John does a
lot of instruction in a variety of fields, and in many forms. At the
moment, he is teaching Advanced Computational Physics to undergrads,
Large Scale Computing to graduate students, and is co-directing the
Mellon College of Science M.S. in Data Analytics Capstone Projects
program.

He is also a founder and main instructor of the NSF Monthly Workshop
Series (Currently hosted by ACCESS), which uses the Wide Area
Classroom format developed at PSC. This longstanding and popular
series has trained over 23,000 live, in-class, students in Data
Science, Machine Learning and Parallel Programming of many sorts.

John also instructs in many other programs. Currently this includes
the International HPC Summer School, The Pennsylvania Governor's
School for the Sciences, the DASIE Summer program and the ADAPT
program for PA Community Colleges and PASSHE Schools, and others that
he regrets omitting when this page was last updated.

John is also a Parallel Computing Scientist at the PSC, where he
continues to provide technical support and develop codes for HPC
platforms. You shouldn't teach what you don't do!
