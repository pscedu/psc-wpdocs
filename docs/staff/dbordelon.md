As a Data Curator and Metadata Librarian, Dominic Bordelon collaborates with data providers and software developers to ensure that PSC repositories offer standardized, high-quality data for utilization in biomedical research. This work includes running and troubleshooting processing pipelines, assessing data submissions for completeness, and communicating with providers and developers to resolve issues, publish data, and participate in the implementation of new repository features. Dominic joined PSC in 2024 and currently works on the [Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)](https://hubmapconsortium.org/) and the [Brain Image Library](https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/).

He earned a Masters of Library and Information Science from Louisiana State University (2013). His interests include research reproducibility and replicability, ethnographic approaches to understanding sociotechnical systems and research communities, and public engagement with science.

Dominic enjoys playing and listening to music, spending time outdoors with his dogs, and contributing to Wikipedia.
