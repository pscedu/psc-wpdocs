## Make a donation

If you benefit from HPN-SSH, please show your support. An important way to show support is by making a donation to the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. I do not personally receive any money from these donations but your support ends up supporting our work.  Any amount is worth while – even a dollar will show PSC and CMU your support for our work. Seriously, show your support in order to both keep HPN-SSH current and fund new improvements.

To support HPN-SSH, go to the PSC giving page at [https://www.psc.edu/giving/](https://www.psc.edu/giving/) and click the “Give online” button.  In the next window, choose “Add a designation” and note that it is to support HPN-SSH. Thank you!
